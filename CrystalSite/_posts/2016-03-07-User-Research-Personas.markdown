For Samuel, mobile games are just a way to pass the time. He generally cycles through multiple games looking for something that interests him enough to lose track of waiting, and is generally neutral towards freerunners or endless fallers; he's open to trying them, but is indifferent at first glance. 
His general level of interest in mobile games is moderate. He would rather be playing a more serious game or doing something more interesting, but if the occasion calls for it he will play them. He is willing to make exceptions if the mobile game is especially entertaining however, and will then commit much more time to playing it. 
Samuel views some games as "gimmicky" due to their forced inclusion of a high score system or tilt control, but feels that under the right circumstances such things could end up being beneficial. 

# Samuel's Goals for a mobile game
* Would like to see a fun, accurate tilt-based control system.
* Would like avenues for friendly competition, as long as it doesn't cause anger.
* Would like a game that engages his interest more than most.

# Personal Profile
"I tend to get easily upset when I lose, so to keep my friendships, I try not to play against my friends."

For Chloe, competition is something she wants to avoid. While she sometimes likes to measure her own progress by high scores or achievements, she doesn't want to compare herself to friends or strangers. For her, it just brings too many bad emotions to the surface that she doesn't enjoy. 
However, she is quite interested in mobile games and likes to try a wide variety based on what catches her eye. It needs to be fun and well made, while offering a bit of a challenge. She also enjoys endless runners and faller styled games, having tried multiple titles in the genre, but they're not her primary focus. 
She tends to play in short bursts of 30 minutes, but she plays frequently throughout the week to check in on her progress or beat that high score she set last time.  

### Chloe's Goals for a mobile game
* Would like an achievement based game.
* Would like avenues for friendly competition, as long as it doesn't cause anger.
* Would like a game free of Player vs Player elements.

For Nathan, mobile games are another potential source of an addiction that will keep his ever changing interests sated. He plays for the entertainment and achievement, liking to compare his scores to his friends but hating to see that his score stacks poorly compared to the best people playing the game. 
However, Nathan needs games that are interesting and engaging in order to devote time to them; if they're just the same thing as every other game, then he will lose interest fast and move on. He also requires that the game have either good mechanics or a good story to keep him coming back for more. 
Overall, Nathan is moderately curious of mobile games as his interest is not exclusive to them, but easily can become so given the right game. Make it new, make it fresh, and make it exciting-- this is what Nathan wants. 

# Nathan's Goals for a mobile game
* Wants a game that offers a new, innovative experience.
* Would like a high score system, but wants to avoid seeing how he stacks up to strangers.
* Would like new game mechanics that aren't copies of older games and don't interfere with gameplay.
