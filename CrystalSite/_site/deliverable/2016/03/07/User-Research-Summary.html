    <h1 id="stakeholders">Stakeholders</h1>

<p>Our stakeholders consist of gamers around the ages of 20 to 30 that have a moderate to high interest in mobile games.</p>

<h1 id="user-research">User Research</h1>

<p>During our research we used two methods of information gathering: structured and semi-structured interviews. We used structured interviews (online surveys) to gather information from our fellow classmates. This supplied us with very concise information. This also allowed us to compile the information efficiently so we could form conclusions in a timely manner.</p>

<p>We then moved on to semi-structured interviews to explore the more complex information such as prior games of the same genre and their likes and dislikes about them. We asked students around campus this time in order to increase our sample size to minimize potential bias. Changing to semi-structured interviews gave us access to new information we otherwise wouldn’t have been able to obtain due to the limited scope of responses that structured surveys provide.</p>

<h1 id="research-findings">Research Findings</h1>

<p>Our research yielded some interesting information. To lay the groundwork, we asked their age, gender, ethnicity, and whether or not they were mobile gamer. Results showed that most responders were male with ages between 21 and 26. The ethnicities on the other hand were very balanced with a strong mix of Caucasian, Asian/Pacific Islander, African American, and Hispanic/Latino. Also, a vast majority said they are mobile gamers. We then asked some general questions their overall interest in mobile games, how often they play, and how long they typically play. The responses showed a very clear lean towards the more casual market. Most responders were either casual or mid core gamers with a moderate interest in mobile gaming. They often played simply when they were bored or had nothing to do at the moment (such as waiting in lines). Gaming sessions longer than an hour were scarce. Following questions showed that most responders were already familiar with the control features such as tilt and showed interest in having these features incorporated in games. Other features such high scores were a little less decisive. However, results still show a very strong support for having a high score incorporated into the game as well as competing with their friends’ scores. Finally, we asked if they had a previous experience with games of the same genre (endless fallers/runners) and whether or not they liked it and showed interest in playing more games like them. Once again, there was strong support for this genre of game with most responses claiming they would be willing to try more games like them.</p>

<h1 id="design-requirements">Design Requirements</h1>

<ul>
  <li>Supports Android and iOS</li>
  <li>Game continues until the player dies</li>
  <li>Incorporates touch and tilt controls
    <ul>
      <li>Must feel natural</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Incorporates a High Score system</li>

</ul>

<h1 id="refined-design-question">Refined Design Question</h1>

<p>How can we incorporate touch and tilt controls to create an engaging, interactive experience for users to enjoy with their friends?
* Explanation: Due to users showing such a strong emphasis on the controls feeling natural, we chose to focus as much as possible on keeping the controls to the game as natural and engaging as possible while also zeroing in on the casual competitive aspect of the high score system.</p>

  <li>Requirement questions</li>
  <li>Would you consider yourself a casual, mid-core, or hardcore mobile gamer?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="definitions">Definitions</h2>

<ul>
  <li>We classify casual as someone who only play games occasionally. Somewhere between a couple times a week to a couple times a month. This also could mean you stick to one type of genre of games.</li>
  <li>Mid-core would be someone who play closer to four to five times a week and play different genres of mobile games. They put time into the games they like and they have a couple of favorites.</li>
  <li>
    <p>Hardcore is considered someone who plays games multiple times a day. They are frequent players who tend to concentrate on either one genre they love in particular or diversify themselves into all their genres just as frequently. They tend to compete with friends or be competitive with anyone who also plays the same games as them.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is your level of interest in mobile games? (On a scale to 1 to 5)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How long is a normal mobile game session for you? (In Minutes/Hours)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do you normally play one mobile game at a time or cycle through multiple games? (Clarification: Are you only playing one game and concentrating on that single game, or do you tend to play multiple mobile games? Name of games not required.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>Are you experienced with touch-based games?</li>
  <li>
    <p>If no, what games do you have experience with?</p>
  </li>
  <li>Have you played games with a tilt feature?</li>

  <li>
    <p>If no, would you consider playing a game with a tilt feature?</p>
  </li>
  <li>Do you like games that have a high scoring system?</li>
  <li>
    <p>If no, why not? (OPEN #1).</p>
  </li>
  <li>Do you enjoy playing competitively against friends?</li>
  <li>
    <p>If no, why do you not enjoy competitive game play?</p>
  </li>
